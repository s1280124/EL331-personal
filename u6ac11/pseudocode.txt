Store the words necessary for discrimination in reigai.
Here we use regular expressions.

Initialize the counter variables as zero.

Read a text file.

for each file
    for each dataset
         Split dataset by ',''.''?' and store it in sentence.

         for each text in sentence
            Add 1 to total.
            Tokenize the text and store this in morph.
            POS tagging of textã€€and store this in pos.

            Initialize variable present,past,future as 999.
            Initialize variable last as -1.
