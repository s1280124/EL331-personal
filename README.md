## Unit5
The repository contains code to perform author analysis on 1-gram, 2-gram, and 3-gram datasets.  

The data set is also included in the repository, and I confirmed that it can be run on Google Colaboratory.  

The 2-gram process took a tremendous amount of time to complete, so we stopped running it halfway through.  

The result of our environment is `. /ENG4/output-result(assignment)/` in .png format.


Although the analysis was actually performed, the output was not "who the author is" but the accuracy of the analysis.

## ENG4
AA for Unit5. Changed some codes for fix Errors cause by running on Google Colaboratory.   
Original Repository: https://github.com/gkhayes/author_attribution  
Mirror: https://github.com/s1280124/EL331-personal/tree/main/ENG4  

### setup & how to use
1. `Download this repository and Unzip`
2. `Create a folder named Colab on your Google Drive and Upload ENG4-folder in Colab folder`
3. `Open create_dataset.ipynb by Google Colaboratory.`
4. `Run codes from head. Last code is write author_data.csv but need wait a few time.`
5. `Next, Open analysis.ipynb by Google Colaboratory.`
6. `Run codes from head. You need wait 2-gram and 3-gram analysis more time than 1-gram analysis. 2-gram analysis did not finish over 3 hours.(about half...)`

These code result is show 3-gram analysis is good accurate more than 1-gram and 2-gram analysis.
